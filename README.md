# Goal App

A simple goal-setting app to understand React Native basics using Expo:
- core components (View, Text, TextInput, Button)
- state with React hooks (useState)
- layout with flexbox
- style with styleSheet objects
- custom components
- props
- handling text input
- handling touches (TouchableOpacity, Modal)
- using ScrollView
- using Flatlist

Based on [React Native - The Practical Guide](https://www.udemy.com/react-native-the-practical-guide/) by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller.
